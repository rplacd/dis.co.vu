# dis.co.vu

The product of 3 nights of frantic work - I'd originally intended to plaster this on a domain I had hanging around but my EC2 free year was running out. A little thing for show - something I could've done in Pipes in 5 minutes - that searches Twitter for tweets around you (although I'll be damned with HTML5 geolocation's worked outside the box on any machine I have close to hand), and pops them up in a bubble on a map. Written in client-heavy JS: I'd intended to learn about Google's Maps API but instead learned more about embracing asynchronicity in a language that's only just recieved a very limited capacity for multithreading.

Just open the lone HTML file.
